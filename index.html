<a name="biography" class="anchor" href="#biography"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Biography</h3>

<p>Marc Newson is known for his funkily futuristic, but technically rigorous approach to design.</p>

<p>Born in Sydney in 1963, Newson spent much of his childhood travelling in Europe and Asia. He started experimenting with furniture design as a student and, after graduation, was awarded a grant from the Australian Crafts Council with which he staged his first exhibition, a piece that has now, twenty years later, set three consecutive world records at auction. He has worked from studios in Tokyo, Paris and, now, London, to design everything from a private jet to a Ford car.</p>

<p>His clients include a broad range of the best known and most prestigious brands in the world - from manufacturing and technology to transportation, fashion and the luxury goods sector as Apple, Canon, Magis, Microsoft, nike and many other.
Many of his designs have been a runaway success for his clients and have achieved the status of modern design icons. In addition to his core business, he has also founded and run a number of successful companies, including a fine watch brand and an aerospace design consultancy.</p>

<p>Marc Newson was included in Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World and has received numerous distinctions and awards. Newson's latest award was the China home trend awards 2013 for Magis Bunky.
He was appointed The Royal Designer for Industry in the UK, received an honorary doctorate from Sydney University, holds Adjunct Professorships at Sydney College of the Arts and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and most recently was created CBE(Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>His work is present in many major museum collections, including the Gagosian in New York, London’s Design Museum and V&amp;A, the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Vitra Design Museum. Having set numerous records at auction, Newson’s work now accounts for almost 25% of the total contemporary design art market.</p>

<p>Newson has been the focus of on-going and intense interest in the media, generating significant editorial value for his clients, and he has been the subject of a number of books and documentary films</p>

<p><em><strong>Description</strong></em><br>
Name: Diode Lamp<br>
Year: 2003<br>
Material: Corian<br>
Size and Colours: various  </p>

<p><em><strong>About</strong></em><br>
With his "Diode" lamps Marc Newson, demonstrates how Corian® can be formed into wonderfully tactile sculptures. By the use of light they appear to radiate an unbelievable shimmering effect. The designer creates an impressive “forest of lights” out of 16 lamps. The illuminated Corian® "tree tops" are at a height of 1.80 m so that the viewer to look directly into their shimmering beauty at close range. </p>

<p>The designer chose the luminous colours Corian® Cameo White, Mandarin and Sun for his project. The boundaries between design installation and design product are blurred together in Newson™s "Diode". They clearly demonstrate that Corian® can be combined with light to create something both artistic and commercial  </p>

</h3>

<p>Through the Rotational Surface function, it was possible design a part of the lamp base. The base is a simple extruded disk. The axis is also an extruded cirle.  </p>

<p>The same function was used to design the lamp head shaped balloon.  </p>

<p><em><strong>About</strong></em><br>
“Sometimes I start with the material, sometimes the idea. In this case the materials were the inspiration. Often the context of materials strikes me more than the materials themselves. Context is new, not materials.” Marc Newson</p>

<a name="my-realization-1" class="anchor" href="#my-realization-1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>My realization</strong>

<p>The approach to design this chair is to use Bezier function to create its profile and its surfaces.

<p><em><strong>Description</strong></em><br>
Name: Bunky Bunk Bed<br>
Year: 2011<br>
Material: Rotational-moulded plyethylene  </p>

<p><em><strong>About</strong></em><br>
Marc Newson created modular bunk bed ‘bunky’ for italian home furnishing company magis, On dis¬play at Milan Design Week 2011. Assembled from just four pieces, it is made from rotational-moulded polyethylene and creates a sturdy, secure sleep and play environment for kids. All surfaces are smooth with no sharp edges.</p>

<p><em><strong>The structure</strong></em></p>

<h3>
<a name="my-realization-2" class="anchor" href="#my-realization-2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>My realization</strong>
</h3>

<p>The first realization was the profile of bed with use of Bezier and Cubic-Hermite function. Especially Cubic-Hermite was used to perform best the smoothest edges. After the surface composition, it was added a plank(a simple cuboid) to the bed.  </p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/Melix89/Melix89.github.io/master/images/Bed/a.%20bed.jpg" alt="1° step"></p>

<p>With Bezier function it's created a pillow and it was combined with a cuboid representing a mattress. Then they were joined to the bed</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/Melix89/Melix89.github.io/master/images/Bed/b.%20bed.jpg" alt="2° step"></p>

<p>The intermediate part is composed by two single parts. It was designed following the way of bed realization.  </p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/Melix89/Melix89.github.io/master/images/Bed/c.%20bed.jpg" alt="3° step"></p>

<p>In the end, all parts were joined, adding an other bed above the intermediate part. The bed is a traslation of the initial bed. To this it was joined a scale, realized by Bezier function.</p>
