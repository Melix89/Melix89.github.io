He started experimenting with furniture design as a student and, after graduation, was awarded a grant from the Australian Crafts Council with which he staged his first exhibition, a piece that has now, twenty years later, set three consecutive world records at auction. He has worked from studios in Tokyo, Paris and, now, London, to design everything from a private jet to a Ford car.\r\n\r\nHis clients include a broad range of the best known and most prestigious brands in the world - from manufacturing and technology to transportation, fashion and the luxury goods sector as Apple, Canon, Magis, Microsoft, nike and many other.\r\nMany of his designs have been a runaway success for his clients and have achieved the status of modern design icons. In addition to his core business, he has also founded and run a number of successful companies, including a fine watch brand and an aerospace design consultancy.\r\n\r\nMarc Newson was included in Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in the World and has received numerous distinctions and awards. Newson's latest award was the China home trend awards 2013 for Magis Bunky.\r\nHe was appointed The Royal Designer for Industry in the UK, received an honorary doctorate from Sydney University, holds Adjunct Professorships at Sydney College of the Arts and Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and most recently was created CBE(Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.\r\n\r\nHis work is present in many major museum collections, including the Gagosian in New York, London’s Design Museum and V&A, the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Vitra Design Museum. Having set numerous records at auction, Newson’s work now accounts for almost 25% of the total contemporary design art market.\r\n\r\nNewson has been the focus of on-going and intense interest in the media, generating significant editorial value for his clients, and he has been the subject of a number of books and documentary films\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
